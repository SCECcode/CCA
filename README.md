The CCA-06 model is a 3D velocity model for Central California.  CCA-06 was produced through 
tomographic inversion, using the USGS Bay Area (v8.3.0), CVM-S4.26, and Lin-Thurber models as 
starting models.  6 iterations were performed on a 500m-resolution mesh, down to a minimum Vs 
of 900 m/s, to generate the final model.  This model includes an optional Ely-Jordan GTL.
