1) Installation

This package is intended to be installed as part of the UCVM framework,
version 15.3.0 or higher. While it is possible to link to this library
using your own C or Fortran code, we recommend using the UCVM suite of
utilities. Most common functions, such as mesh generation and query 
capabilities, are already in there.

2) Library

The library ./lib/libcca.a may be statically linked into any
user application. Also, if your system supports dynamic linking,
you will also have a ./lib/libcca.so file that can be used
for dynamic linking. The header file defining the API is located
in ./include/cca.h.

3) Contact the authors

If you would like to contact the authors regarding this software,
please e-mail software@scec.org. Note this e-mail address should
be used for questions regarding the software itself (e.g. how
do I link the library properly?). Questions regarding the model's
science (e.g. on what paper is the GTL based?) should be directed
to the model's authors, located in the AUTHORS file.
